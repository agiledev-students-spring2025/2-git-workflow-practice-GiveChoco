What's fascinating about this concept is how it reflects the evolving nature of tech roles in modern software development. Product engineers are said to have the same goals as product managers but approach problems from a more technical perspective, actually shipping code themselves. This blending of responsibilities highlights the increasing need for versatility in the tech industry, where understanding both the technical and product aspects can lead to more efficient and innovative solutions.

The article from PostHog illustrates how the lines between product management and software engineering can blur, especially in tech-focused companies. It suggests that some organizations are recognizing the value of professionals who can bridge the gap between these traditionally separate roles. This trend towards hybrid roles like product engineers demonstrates the industry's adaptation to the complex, fast-paced nature of modern software development, where close collaboration and multidisciplinary skills are increasingly valuable.
